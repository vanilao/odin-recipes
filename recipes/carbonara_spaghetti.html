    <h3>👩‍🍳 Steps to Follow</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil the pasta:
        <dl>
          Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti until al dente.
          Save 1 cup of pasta water before draining – it’s liquid gold.
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the pork:
        <dl>
          While pasta cooks, dice the guanciale and toss it into a cold pan.
          Turn heat to medium and let it slowly render until crispy and golden.
          Turn off the heat.
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the sauce:
        <dl>
          In a bowl, whisk together egg yolks, whole egg, grated cheese, and a
          good hit of black pepper. It should be thick and creamy – like a
          savory custard.s
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine:
        <dl>
          Add the drained pasta into the pan with the pork (heat off –
          important!). Toss it to coat in the fat. Slowly pour in the egg
          mixture while stirring quickly to avoid scrambling. Add splashes of
          hot pasta water until it becomes glossy, silky, and clings to every
          strand.
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately:
        <dl>
          Plate it. Top with more cheese and pepper. Stare at it lovingly before
          inhaling it like a Roman god.
        </dl>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>💡 Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No cream. Never. Don’t even think about it.</li>
      <li>Work fast once the eggs go in — this is where people mess up.</li>
      <li>
        Guanciale is the traditional cut — fatty, flavorful, glorious. But
        pancetta or bacon can hold their own.
      </li>
    </ul>
