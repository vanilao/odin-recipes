      Shredded green papaya pounded with garlic, chilies, fish sauce, lime,
      dried shrimp, palm sugar, tomato, and roasted peanuts. Served fresh, cold,
      and usually with sticky rice or grilled meat. It’s chaos in a mortar — in
      the best way.

    <h2>🥣 Tools Needed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mortar & pestle (preferred)</li>
      <li>
        Or… big bowl + something heavy to mash (like a wooden spoon and rage)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>👩‍🍳 Steps to Follow</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pound garlic + chili:
        <dl>
          Add garlic and chilies into the mortar and gently pound to bruise and
          release flavor — not obliterate. (If you’re new to spice, start with 1
          chili.)
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add shrimp + beans + peanuts:
        <dl>
          Add dried shrimp, green beans, and a spoonful of peanuts. Lightly
          crush them. You're layering flavors.
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sugar + fish sauce + lime juice:
        <dl>
          Scoop in palm sugar, fish sauce, and lime juice. Mix and mash to
          dissolve sugar. Taste it. Adjust. You're looking for sweet + salty +
          sour + spicy harmony.
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add papaya + tomatoes:
        <dl>
          Toss in shredded papaya and tomatoes. Use a spoon in one hand to turn
          and mix while the other hand gently pounds with the pestle. Mix
          thoroughly without smashing it to mush.
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately:
        <dl>
          Plate it. Top with extra peanuts if you’re feeling fancy. Serve with
          sticky rice, grilled chicken, or just eat it like a feral god in front
          of a fan.
        </dl>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>🔥 Tips From the Street:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No mortar? No problem. Mash ingredients in a bowl with a spoon, but be
        gentle.
      </li>
      <li>Green mango or cucumber can sub for papaya if you’re in a pinch.</li>
      <li>
        This dish doesn't keep well. Eat it fresh or suffer the soggy fate.
      </li>
    </ul>
